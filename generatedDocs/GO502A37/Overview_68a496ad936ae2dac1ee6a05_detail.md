- **value**: As a Bank Reconciliation Specialist, I want a centralized integration hub that consolidates data from multiple system tables and provides a unified view of all suspended transactions so that I can perform comprehensive reconciliation and audit activities efficiently. The integration hub should connect to various database tables containing transaction data, account information, branch details, and historical records to create a complete picture of each suspended transaction. It should provide real-time data synchronization capabilities, handle data conflicts and inconsistencies, and maintain data lineage for audit purposes. The system should support complex queries and filtering options to allow users to drill down into specific transaction categories, time periods, or branch operations. Additionally, it should provide APIs for external system integration and support data export capabilities for further analysis in specialized reconciliation tools.
