- **value**: As a quality assurance engineer, I want to establish a comprehensive testing and validation framework for the modernized system so that we can ensure complete functional equivalence with the legacy COBOL program while validating improved performance and maintainability. This framework must include automated regression testing comparing outputs between the legacy and modern systems, performance benchmarking to validate that the new system meets or exceeds current performance standards, data integrity validation across all migrated database tables, and end-to-end business process testing covering all critical workflows including suspended transaction processing, contract management, and SAP integration scenarios. The framework should also include load testing capabilities to validate system scalability, security testing to ensure proper access controls and data protection, and disaster recovery testing to validate backup and recovery procedures. All testing must be documented with clear pass/fail criteria and automated where possible to support continuous integration and deployment practices.
