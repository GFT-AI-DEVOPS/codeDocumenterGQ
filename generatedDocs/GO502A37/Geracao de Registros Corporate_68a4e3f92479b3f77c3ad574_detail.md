- **name**: Description
- **value**: As a developer, I want to implement a functionality to generate standardized records for integration with the Corporate system. This functionality will ensure that detailed transaction data is accurately captured and formatted according to the specified structure. The implementation will include the following:
- Define and initialize the data structures required for processing suspended transactions, including input, output, and essential working variables.
- Map all relevant fields such as PKNISUSPENSO (primary key), FKNICONTRATO (foreign key), ATNDVALORCR (transaction value), and others as described in the provided data structure.
- Implement validation rules for mandatory fields, ensuring that critical fields like transaction status (ATSFSTATUS) and processing date (ATDTPROCSUSP) are always populated.
- Develop logic to handle null fields by converting them to default values (e.g., zeros or spaces).
- Ensure compatibility with the Corporate system by adhering to the specified data formats and field sizes.
- Include error handling for SQL operations and ensure proper logging of any issues encountered during record generation.
- Test the functionality with various scenarios to validate the accuracy and reliability of the generated records.
