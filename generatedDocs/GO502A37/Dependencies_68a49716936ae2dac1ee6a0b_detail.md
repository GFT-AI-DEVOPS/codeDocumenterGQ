- **name**: Description
- **value**: As a system integrator, I want to modernize the legacy utility programs YY035A and YY115A by replacing them with modern API-based solutions so that the system can eliminate dependencies on external COBOL programs while maintaining equivalent functionality. YY035A handles output file control and must be replaced with a modern file management service that can handle file operations, logging, and monitoring through RESTful APIs or microservices architecture. YY115A provides system date and time functionality and should be replaced with standard system libraries or cloud-based time services that offer better reliability and timezone handling. The modernization should include proper error handling, logging capabilities, and integration with the new application monitoring systems. All existing interfaces and expected outputs must be preserved to ensure seamless integration with other system components during the transition period.
