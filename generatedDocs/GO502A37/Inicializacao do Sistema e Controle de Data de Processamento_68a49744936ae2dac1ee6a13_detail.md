- **value**: As a system administrator, I want all totalization variables to be properly initialized to zero at system startup, so that calculations and accumulations start from a clean state and produce accurate results. This story involves implementing the variable initialization functionality that ensures all totalization variables used throughout the system are set to zero before any processing begins. The implementation must identify all variables that require initialization, establish a systematic approach to variable management, and ensure that the initialization process is complete and reliable. The system should maintain a registry of all totalization variables, provide verification that initialization has completed successfully, and establish proper variable scoping and lifecycle management. This foundational capability is essential for ensuring data accuracy and preventing calculation errors that could result from uninitialized or residual variable values from previous processing sessions.
