- **value**: As a Bank Operations Analyst, I want an automated system that generates comprehensive legends and explanations for all codes used in the reports so that users can easily understand and interpret the transaction data without requiring extensive training or external documentation. The system should maintain a centralized repository of all transaction codes, status codes, operation type codes, and branch codes used throughout the application. It should automatically generate explanatory legends that accompany reports, providing clear descriptions of what each code represents in business terms. The legend generator should support multiple languages if required, maintain version control for code definitions, and ensure that legends are always current and accurate. The system should also provide search and lookup capabilities for code meanings and support the addition of new codes through a controlled process.
