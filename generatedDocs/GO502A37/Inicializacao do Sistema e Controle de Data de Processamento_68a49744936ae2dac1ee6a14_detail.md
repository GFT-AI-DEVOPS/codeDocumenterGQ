- **value**: As a financial system integrator, I want the system to properly configure accounting accounts for different SAP operation types, so that financial transactions are correctly categorized and processed according to established accounting rules. This story involves implementing the SAP account configuration functionality that processes specific SAP codes (3412, 3413, 4412) and establishes the corresponding debit and credit accounts for each operation type. The implementation must define the WS06CONVCOMPLEMENTO variable for each SAP code, call the R069ACESSACONTA routine to retrieve the appropriate debit and credit accounts, and store these accounts in the corresponding WSCTDEBITO and WSCTCREDITO variables. The system should handle account retrieval errors, validate account information, ensure proper mapping between SAP codes and account types, and maintain data consistency throughout the configuration process. After successful configuration, the system must execute a COMMIT operation to confirm the transaction and ensure data persistence. This functionality is critical for maintaining proper financial controls and ensuring accurate accounting integration with SAP systems.
