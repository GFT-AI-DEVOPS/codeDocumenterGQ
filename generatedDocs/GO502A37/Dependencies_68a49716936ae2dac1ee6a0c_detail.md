- **name**: Description
- **value**: As a business analyst, I want to migrate the core business logic from the COBOL program GO502A37 to a modern application architecture while ensuring seamless integration with SAP systems so that business operations can continue without disruption and benefit from improved maintainability and scalability. This involves analyzing the suspended transactions processing logic, contract management workflows, absorption processes, and accounting entry configurations. The migration must preserve all business rules related to transaction processing, control flow management, and organizational hierarchies. Special attention must be given to the PAKG111VLANCTOCON table configuration for accounting entries as it is essential for SAP integration. The new system should implement proper business rule engines, workflow management, and integration patterns that can easily interface with SAP modules while maintaining audit trails and compliance requirements.
