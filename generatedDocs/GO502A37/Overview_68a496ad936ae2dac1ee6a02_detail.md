- **value**: As a Bank Compliance Officer, I want a flexible report generation system that can produce detailed reports in multiple output formats so that I can distribute information to different stakeholders and systems according to their specific requirements. The system must generate printed reports for physical documentation, create files compatible with SAP system integration, and produce data exports for the Corporate system. Each output format should maintain data consistency while adapting to the specific formatting requirements of the target system or medium. The report generation should include proper formatting, headers, footers, page breaks for printed reports, and structured data formats for system integrations. The system should also handle report scheduling, batch processing, and provide options for both on-demand and automated report generation.
