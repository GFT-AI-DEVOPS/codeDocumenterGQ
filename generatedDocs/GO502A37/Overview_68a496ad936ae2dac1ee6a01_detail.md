- **name**: Description
- **value**: As a Bank Operations Manager, I want a core processing engine that can retrieve and classify suspended transactions from the current account system so that I can have accurate data for generating comprehensive reports. The system needs to connect to multiple database tables containing transaction data and apply business rules to categorize transactions by their status (pending, regularized, settled, transferred) and operation type. This engine should handle large volumes of transaction data efficiently and provide the foundation for all reporting capabilities. The processing should include data validation, error handling, and logging mechanisms to ensure data integrity and traceability of all operations performed on the transaction records.
