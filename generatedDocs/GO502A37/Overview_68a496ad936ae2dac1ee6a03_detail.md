- **name**: Description
- **value**: As a Financial Controller, I want an automated calculation system that computes accurate totals by branch and overall totals so that I can have consolidated financial summaries for decision-making and regulatory reporting. The system should process all classified transactions and calculate subtotals for each branch office, including breakdowns by transaction type and status. Additionally, it should compute grand totals across all branches to provide a comprehensive view of the bank's suspended transaction portfolio. The calculation engine must handle different currencies if applicable, apply proper rounding rules, and maintain mathematical accuracy throughout all computations. The system should also provide variance analysis capabilities and support drill-down functionality to trace totals back to individual transactions for audit purposes.
