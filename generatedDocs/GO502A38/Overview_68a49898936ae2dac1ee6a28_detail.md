- **name**: Description
- **value**: As a bank reconciliation specialist, I want a centralized integration hub that consolidates data from multiple system tables to provide a unified view of all suspended transactions so that I can perform comprehensive reconciliation and audit activities efficiently. The integration hub should connect to various database tables containing transaction data, account information, branch details, and historical records to create a complete picture of each suspended transaction. The system must handle data synchronization, resolve conflicts between different data sources, and maintain referential integrity across all integrated tables. This hub will serve as the single source of truth for reconciliation processes, enabling accurate tracking of transaction lifecycles from suspension through resolution, and supporting both automated reconciliation processes and manual audit procedures.
