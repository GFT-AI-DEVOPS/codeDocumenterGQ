- **name**: Description
- **value**: As a bank operations manager, I want a core processing engine that can retrieve and classify suspended transactions from the current account system so that I can have accurate data for generating comprehensive reports. The system needs to connect to multiple database tables containing transaction data and apply business rules to categorize transactions by status (pending, regularized, settled, transferred) and operation type. The processing engine should handle large volumes of transaction data efficiently and maintain data integrity throughout the classification process. This foundational component will serve as the backbone for all reporting functionalities, ensuring that downstream processes receive properly structured and categorized transaction data.
